# ReactorDisplay

This C# program simulates a basic reactor monitoring system. It collects and displays information related to the reactorâ€™s core temperature, radiation level, and operational status. Here's how it works:

1. **Core Temperature Input**:
   - The program prompts the user to input the core temperature of the reactor. It reads this value as a floating-point number (for decimals) and then displays the temperature back to the user.

2. **Radiation Level Input**:
   - Next, the program asks for the radiation level in the reactor, again reading it as a floating-point number to handle decimal values. It displays the entered radiation level to the user.

3. **Operational Status Input**:
   - The program then prompts the user to input whether the reactor is operational, accepting "yes" or "no" as valid input. Based on this input, it prints a message indicating if the reactor is operational or not.

4. **Display Results**:
   - After collecting the inputs, the program provides feedback on the core temperature, radiation level, and whether the reactor is operational.

This program could be used in a simple simulation or monitoring tool for reactor systems, where a user (such as an operator) inputs real-time data about the reactor and receives immediate feedback about its status.
